# Scientific Teams - SOPs
Public repository for cross-consortia data coordination center (DCC) documentation.

[Data Quality Annotation](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sciTeams-SOP/blob/master/docs/data_quality_annotation.md): Improved data validation tools lead to use cases where data quality issues were not identified at the time of upload and public data release. The data quality annotation is meant to flag data users of these issues. The objective is to (1) alert users of the problematic file and (2) provide users a direct link to release notes for comprehensive QC details.

[Security Incident Reporting and Criteria to Remove Data from Synapse](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sciTeams-SOP/blob/master/docs/data_redaction_criteria.md): Data stored in Synapse will be redacted only in the case of a violation of conditions of use or data breach. Incidents are managed through the Jira issues generated by the reporting process. Data redaction is when data are permanently dereferenced from Sageâ€™s platforms.
