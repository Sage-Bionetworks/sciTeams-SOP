[Data Quality Annotation](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sciTeams-SOP/blob/master/docs/data_quality_annotation.md): Improved data validation tools lead to use cases where data quality issues were not identified at the time of upload and public data release. The data quality annotation is meant to flag data users of these issues. The objective is to (1) alert users of the problematic file and (2) provide users a direct link to release notes for comprehensive QC details.

[Data Redaction Criteria](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sciTeams-SOP/blob/master/docs/data_redaction_criteria.md): Data will typically be updated via an incremental file version or quality control annotation. In the case of a governance breach, data will be fully redacted.
