## Security Incident Reporting and Criteria to Remove Data from Synapse

**Purpose**: Data stored in Synapse will be redacted only in the case of a violation of conditions of use or data breach. Incidents are managed through the Jira issues generated by the reporting process. Data redaction is when data are permanently dereferenced from Sage’s platforms. Sage Bionetworks will not recover redacted Synapse data. This includes all versions of the file and any associated metadata entries. 

**Definition**:

Violation of conditions of use - Data may be redacted from Synapse if the dataset contains elements that do not match its intended use.

Redaction - Data is permanently removed from Synapse. Sage Bionetworks will not recover redacted Synapse data. This includes all versions of the file and any associated metadata entries. 

Data breach - A data breach is when data are inadvertently disclosed. This could be a release of data that has regulatory confidentiality requirements, like PHI, or data that have not been consented for sharing. A breach is a security incident that requires forensic analysis and possible reporting to partners or regulators. Data may be redacted when Governance determines that the dataset contains identifiers incongruent with its conditions or use and the data are inadvertently disclosed. For example, when data containing identifiers are attached in a project designed for broad sharing, the data may be redacted and also be reattached after deidentification or, if project requirements allow, sharing permissions are corrected. If possible, identifier key should not be shared with Sage. 
Samples may be removed from a consortium at the request of its governing body (e.g. NIMH). 

Requests for changes due to data quality concerns - For managing a scenario where a data contributor flags existing stored data as questionable in quality, [data may be annotated to reflect quality but not redacted](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sciTeams-SOP/blob/master/docs/data_quality_annotation.md).

**Procedure**: When a Synapse user views an entity page with the web client, they can report issues directly through the page’s “report issue” button.

This is the best way to report an incident because it creates a standard JIRA ticket Sage can use for incident response purposes. The incident response process relies on standardization so that triage and response can be managed quickly and consistently. If you need to report an incident and the “report issue” action is not available, please email act@sagebase.org with the detail of the incident.
